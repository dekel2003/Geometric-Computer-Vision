CMake Error at D:/programs/JetBrains/CLion 2016.3.2/bin/cmake/share/cmake-3.6/Modules/CMakeMinGWFindMake.cmake:22 (message):
  sh.exe was found in your PATH, here:

  D:/Tools/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin/sh.exe

  For MinGW make to work correctly sh.exe must NOT be in your path.

  Run cmake from a shell that does not have sh.exe in your PATH.

  If you want to use a UNIX shell, then use MSYS Makefiles.
